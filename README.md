# Product-management-system
# E-Commerce Product Management System
Overview
This project implements a robust product management system using Spring Boot with advanced features such as profiles, external configuration, and actuators. The system supports efficient request handling with Dispatcher Servlet, including interceptors, data binding, and response handling. It uses Spring Data JPA for relational database interactions and Spring Data for NoSQL stores. Additionally, a binary tree structure is implemented for efficient product categorization and retrieval.

Project Objectives
Implement a robust product management system using Spring Boot.
Develop efficient request handling with Dispatcher Servlet.
Utilize Spring Data JPA for relational database interactions and Spring Data for NoSQL stores.
Implement binary trees for efficient product categorization and retrieval.


# Implementation Details
## Spring Boot Setup
Initialize a Spring Boot Project:
Include dependencies: Spring Web, Spring Data JPA, Spring Data MongoDB, Spring Boot Actuator.
Configure application properties for different profiles (development, production).

Enable and configure Spring Actuators for monitoring.

Request Handling
Dispatcher Servlet Configuration:
Utilize data binding and type conversion for processing incoming requests.
Handle response generation, including success and error responses.
Spring Data Integration


Create custom queries using JPQL and native SQL.
Implement pagination and sorting features for product listings.

# NoSQL Database (MongoDB):
Integrate with MongoDB for additional data storage.

# Binary Tree Implementation
Product Categorization:
Develop a binary tree structure for categorizing products.
Implement methods for adding, deleting, and searching products within the binary tree.
Integrate binary tree operations with the product management system for efficient categorization and retrieval.
